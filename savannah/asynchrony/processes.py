    # Rationale:
    # ----------
    # In threads, direct references to objects are possible.
    # For this reason, we can make a thread of an instance method that is passed
    # `self` as a first argument without any problem.
    # However, processes cannot share memory, and to emulate "memory reference"
    # What is done is to actually duplicate objects and create copies of them.
    # Elements that require to be updated either use a pipe or a background server
    # which in turn uses pipes/sockets.
    #
    # If we try to pickle the method to pass to the process, and `self` contains
    # a reciprocal reference to a manager, `pickle`-ing will be unsuccessful
    # because it will join an infinite loop: pickling self will imply pickling the
    # reference to the manager, which in turn contains a reference to self, and so.
    # (Pickle does not yet let serialization of objects that have a cross-reference).
    # For this reason, method has to be static (this is, be stored as a class variable).

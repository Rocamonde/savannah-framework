# Commit history

When miscellaneous changes are implemented into a commit, 
I will make reference to them in this file,
to be able to expand on them further than a brief compilation
in the commit message.


### Commit [1c0165bb0564b5a6d1e921d4f1830d68bb8fc1f7](https://github.com/Rocamonde/savannah-framework/commit/1c0165bb0564b5a6d1e921d4f1830d68bb8fc1f7)

 - Rollback to using standard multiprocessing. Provides easier way to debug.

 - Restructured cli_commands folder. Difficult to write command instructions in a file that is huge. Prefer to write a file for every command.

 - Now able to run tests from manage. Either a file or a folder. Supports output to files.

 - Added testenv folder for easier testing.
